### Greetings my name is Jake Mednikov. I graduated in May of 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science. I am constantly improving myself by learning new skills (most recently HTML5 and JavaScript). I recently completed a collaborative project: Web Scraper (https://github.com/originalanon/WSL_Web_Scraper). I have also developed on a few other projects both in my studies as well as on my own. Here are two examples coded in Python. One is a single player Tic-Tac_Toe game where the AI works on a Min-Max algorithem (https://github.com/jmednikov/Udemy-Projects/blob/master/Milesone_Project_1.py). The other is a single player game of Blackjack that is text based (https://github.com/jmednikov/Udemy-Projects/blob/master/Blackjack.py). You can reach me via my email of jmednikov13@gmail.com if you want to chat or use some of my code.
